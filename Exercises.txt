 Bonus query:

  Create a query which will join all tables and show all data from all tables.
  
SELECT * from employees


 Next step:

 Now you should create at least 5 queries on your own, try to use data from more than 2 tables.
 
 
 1) 
 --		SELECT ALL EMPLOYES IN SPECIFIC APPARTMENT
 
 SELECT *
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_emp d
on e.emp_no = d.emp_no
WHERE dept_no IN ("d005")

2) 
--SELECT EMPLOYES WITH SALARY BETWEEND 70l - 80k



SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees e 
JOIN salaries s
on e.emp_no = s.emp_no
WHERE salary BETWEEN 70000 AND 80000
 
 //STILL Shows the date duplicates because of the yearly salaray raise, cant fix it
 3)
 --SHOW ALL EMPLOYES WITH A OR P in the first name

 SELECT * FROM `employees` WHERE first_name REGEXP "[ap]"
4)
--Checking the Database if every employee got a gender with null operator

SELECT * FROM `employees` WHERE gender IS NULL

5)
-- Select employes sorted by their first name descending with a output limit of 100 entrys

SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name DESC
LIMIT 100
